## Usage to create the HTML Resume

Run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `package.json` file to see which scripts are included.

### npm Scripts

- `npm run build` builds the project - this builds assets, HTML, JS, and CSS into `docs`
- `npm run build:assets` copies the files in the `src/assets/` directory into `docs`
- `npm run build:pug` compiles the Pug located in the `src/pug/` directory into `docs`
- `npm run build:scripts` brings the `src/js/scripts.js` file into `docs`
- `npm run build:scss` compiles the SCSS files located in the `src/scss/` directory into `docs`
- `npm run clean` deletes the `docs` directory to prepare for rebuilding the project
- `npm run start:debug` runs the project in debug mode
- `npm start` or `npm run start` runs the project, launches a live preview in your default browser, and watches for changes made to files in `src`

You must have npm installed in order to use this build environment.
